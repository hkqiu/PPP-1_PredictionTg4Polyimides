# PPP-1_PredictionTg4Polyimides
This is the 1st part of project PPP-Prediction Properties of Polymers, and this work predicts Tg of polyimides using GNN, while more than 8,000,000 Tg data being provided. One can access the 8,000,000 polyimides at [Machine learning enables interpretable discovery of innovative polymers for gas separation membranes](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abn9545). 

And our work is: [Design of Polyimides with Targeted Glass Transition Temperature Using Graph Neural Network](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2023/TC/D2TC05174E)
